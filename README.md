# WindowsTime_2.0_EN
Shell script shutting down the system after the time specified by the configuration file. 

The project uses mainly the BATCH programming language (windows shell), plus a few functions written in VisualBasic and Powershell. The goal is to effectively block access to the computer for a person who spends too much time using it.

No registration or internet connection is required for installation. Each operation is performed locally. No ads, costs or METADATA extraction, pure functionality and simplicity of operation.

The program works effectively on the windows environment in all software and language versions, starting from Windows 10 - 1507.

Not tested on previous versions of Windows, eg 7 or 8. In general, it should also work where Powershell was implied.
